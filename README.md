MindYourHealth

My application is for patients and doctors. It lets those who dont have active access to
health care get a virtual pre-diagnostic from a volunteering health professional.
Professionals can include excelling medical students and doctors. This way patients can
have an early warning to someting serious or have peace of mind without getting a
scary diagnostic from Google. The way this works is when a user login the their profile,
they will be able to send their symptoms to a health professional. This professional will
be able to send a diagnostic back to the user.
