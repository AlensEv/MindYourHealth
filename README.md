# MindYourHealth
My application is for patients and doctors. It lets those who dont have active access to
health care get a virtual pre-diagnostic from a volunteering health professional.
Professionals can include excelling medical students and doctors. This way patients can
have an early warning to someting serious or have peace of mind without getting a
scary diagnostic from Google. The way this works is when a user login the their profile,
they will be able to send their symptoms to a health professional. This professional will
be able to send a diagnostic back to the user.

## Commnuity Impact 

→ SOCIAL ISSUE: HUMAN RIGHTS

I plan on creating an application for patients and doctors. I have had the experience where I feel sick or feel like I'm developing symptoms. When I go to search on Google for these symptoms, I get these very scary results and feel like it is the end of the world, so I just go to the doctor's office. It wasn't until recently I had that same situation but my insurance had expired, and I couldn't immediately go to the doctor's office until my insurance had been fully processed. It was a very scary moment because I was stuck with Google and felt like the world was about to end, only to find out months later that I was fine. I realized that there are many people who go through the same situation every day and have it worse than me because they aren't able to afford healthcare at all.

My application would let those who don't have active access to healthcare get a virtual pre-diagnosis from a volunteering health professional. Professionals can include excelling medical students and doctors. This way, patients can have an early warning to something serious or have peace of mind without getting a scary diagnosis from Google.
