  <h1>About us </h1>

  <h5>My application is for patients and doctors. It  lets those who dont have active access to health care get a virtual pre-diagnostic from a volunteering health professional. 
  Professionals can include excelling medical students and doctors. This way patients can have an early warning to someting serious or have peace of mind without getting a scary diagnostic from Google.
   The way this works is when a user login the their profile, they will be able to send their symptoms to a health professional. This professional will be able to send a diagnostic back to the user.
